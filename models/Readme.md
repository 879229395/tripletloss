Please download the pre-trained model from [here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qY5UVxi).

Finetune this model with tripletloss,or re-train the model on your own dataset.

'''[Here](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYpFZeG) I also provide a trained model for you.'''
I set an unreasonable initial value to bias in fc9. So the output feature is biased, Some of the features which are not used are almost the same as the useful features.
If you want to use it, the output feature should be fitted by PCA.

I'll provide a new model recently......
