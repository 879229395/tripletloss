# TripletLoss Layer Example

This aims to reproduce the loss function used in Google's [FaceNet paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832v1).

This is just an example which shows how to use the method to train a model.

# Online sample selection

I provide an online triplet sample selection usage. 

## Setup

Rebuild your caffe directory and makesure your python could find the added layers.
